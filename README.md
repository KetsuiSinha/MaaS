Here’s a **detailed Markdown for your MaaS (Mock as a Service) project** that you can use for GitHub or documentation.

# MaaS (Mock as a Service) 🚀

MaaS is a **Postman-like SaaS application** built with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**. It enables developers, testers, and teams to **create, manage, and test mock APIs** with ease. Think of it as a lightweight, customizable alternative to Postman or Mockoon – but entirely SaaS and team-oriented.

---

## 📌 Features

* **API Mocking**

  * Create mock APIs with custom endpoints.
  * Define HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.).
  * Add custom request headers and parameters.
  * Configure response bodies, status codes, and delays.

* **Collections & Workspaces**

  * Group mock APIs into collections.
  * Organize workspaces for different teams/projects.
  * Share collections across users.

* **Request Testing Console**

  * Built-in interface to test endpoints (like Postman).
  * View requests and responses in real-time.

* **Authentication & Security**

  * JWT-based authentication for users.
  * Role-based access for team collaboration.

* **Persistence & Versioning**

  * Save mock API history and revisions.
  * Rollback to older configurations when needed.

* **Scalable SaaS Model**

  * Multi-tenant SaaS setup for different organizations.
  * Admin dashboard for monitoring usage.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + ShadCN/UI
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
* **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)
* **Auth**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
* **Other Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, Axios, Vite (for frontend build)

## 📊 Example API Flow

1. **Create Mock API**

   * Method: `POST /api/mocks`
   * Body:

     ```json
     {
       "endpoint": "/users",
       "method": "GET",
       "response": {
         "status": 200,
         "body": { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe" }
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Call the Mock API**

   * Request: `GET /mocks/users`
   * Response:

     ```json
     {
       "id": 1,
       "name": "John Doe"
     }
     ```
